# Customer Segmentation Project - Miuul Bootcamp

This project shows how to analyze customers by grouping them based on sales data.

## Project Overview

The goal is to study sales data to find different types of customers and group them by how much revenue they bring. This helps us understand customers better and plan marketing more easily.

Key steps include:
- Loading and exploring the dataset
- Analyzing sales distribution by country, source, gender, and age
- Creating meaningful age categories for better segmentation
- Combining demographic features to build customer personas
- Segmenting customers into revenue-based groups (A to D)
- Predicting expected revenue for new customer profiles

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- pandas library for data manipulation and analysis
